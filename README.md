transcription factor binding site code

this code identifies potential transcription factor binding sites in DNA intron sequences (with small edits to the code or a change to the input file it can also scan any other sequence, look at comments in code). it will identify the bidning sites on the reverse complementary strand of dna as well but without the need to input the reverse complementary strand (it uses the reverse complementary position frequency matrix instead).
